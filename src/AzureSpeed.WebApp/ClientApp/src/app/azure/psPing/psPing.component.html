        The major drawback of this web based Azure speed test tool is that this tool does not measure latency with ICMP ping or TCP ping,
        due to browser limitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to measure ICMP ping latency to Azure datacenters, you might want to check a great tool called PsPing from PsTools
        suite. PsPing is a command-line utility for measuring network performance, it implements Ping functionality, TCP ping, latency and
        bandwidth measurement.
      </p>
      Here is how to run your network latency test using PsPing tool:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download PsTools from
          <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896649.aspx" target="_blank"
            >http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896649.aspx</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Extract the whole package, open a command prompt and run the following command
          <pre>psping target:port</pre>
          The target can be ip or dns name of Virtual Machine, Storage, SQL Database and other endpoints that is public accessible
        </li>
      </ol>
      At the end, you will see an output similar to the one below (here I am using a storage endpoint and port 80 as target), with latency
      results (in milliseconds)

        <li>
          Azure blocks external ICMP protocol so general ping.exe which uses ICMP protocol does not work. PsPing test connectivity to a
          specific TCP port directly which is not blocked
        </li>
        <li>
